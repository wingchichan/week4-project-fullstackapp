# Week 4 Project - Fullstack

- Although this week's project was a challenge, I quite enjoyed working on it. I used the lesson recordings as a guide to set up the correct folders, files and dependencies in the client and server side as it was a little confusing.

- I believe I've met all the basic requirements - my review page successfully GETS and POSTs reviews to and from the client and server, I've included a media query so the layout changes when the screen size is bigger.
- For the stretch goals, I have included some validation i.e. ensuring the input fields are filled before you can submit. I have also applied position sticky to the form area (in wide screen) so it stays in place making it easier for the user to access it.
- If I had more time I would have attempted to included a DELETE post route.
- I'm still struggling to grasp the idea of separating out chunks of code into functions and passing in parameters.
- I used a mix of W3School, MDN, Mozilla, GeeksforGeeks, Stack Overflow and family for help.
